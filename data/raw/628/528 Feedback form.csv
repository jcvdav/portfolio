A lot of times I understand what the slides are saying, but I need to refer to them on coding session days. A quick demonstration combining what we've learned so far on the screen during lecture would be helpful in applying the material, rather than reading the already scripted code. Or, showing what the code is doing in each step through live coding."

I think each class still deserves a 5, because in each, we are all learning new things and getting information regarding good practices, data analyses, and reproducibility. I think that the classes are at a very good pace, and that the professor ensures everyone can learn by answering a broad variety of questions and giving us a step-by-step process, with more advanced stuff included. I do believe that maybe some folks could benefit from getting some code before class that helps them follow better what is going on. I don't think we need more assignments, but more information regarding the code we will be running before the class. "

I have recommended it to multiple friends already. My only thing I would change is, you are incredible at explaining things in class/in person and I love how you explain the why, but some of that gets lost in writing when describing assignments/written assignments or written content. Sometimes the written content does not go into enough detail for me and I feel slightly lost on what is being asked of me to do/would appreciate slightly more information written out. Though the live coding has been helpful. I think I just felt confused on what was being asked of me with the first assignment/slight disconnect between what was described in class and what the assignment was asking. Maybe more fleshed out written instructions on assignments. That being said, please please continue explaining the WHY we are doing something and not just how/what we are doing. The WHY and actually going through step by step what we coded has been incredibly helpful for how my brain works/learns. Overall really excellent class so far :)"

I think it is hard for me to just know exactly what to do or memorize what you're saying to do when we do live coding sessions. "
"2025/09/30 9:03:35 AM AST","5","3","2","3","3","Agree","Agree","Disagree","Agree","More live coding through the lectures to break up the material. It can be easy to forget what i learned in lectures on Tuesday and then to apply it on Thursday. It would be better to learn and practice applying at the same day and it will make it more interactive for me"

And maybe after we're shown how to do it there could be a second question around the same topic to see if it has stuck in our brains after you have walked us through it right before. "

"2025/09/30 9:06:28 AM AST","4","4","3","3","3","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","I do think having recordings available of the live coding sessions for students would be helpful to have as additional learning resources. For me, I find that questions from students are helpful to reflect on as well as when something is debugged live, it would be great to have a resource of seeing that if in the future I face a similar problem but forgot what the solution was because I didn't encounter it during the live coding sessions (if that makes sense).

For frequent assignments, an assignment every two weeks I think would be helpful (maybe that will be the structure moving forward) but I think a small assignment to solidify the knowledge learned could be helpful. "

"2025/09/30 9:06:47 AM AST","5","3","3","3","2","Disagree","Agree","Disagree","Agree","I think something that could enhance the coding sessions is, when asking the students what they did to achieve something during one of the steps, asking them why they did exactly what they did during the steps or explaining why they may have done that as opposed to another method if there are other applicable methods to the coding they just did."
"2025/09/30 9:07:00 AM AST","2","2","2","2","2","Disagree","Agree","Disagree","Agree","I'm not very familiar with R or quantitative methods, so I'm still getting used to both the logic and the structure of the coding. Some of the terminology used in class and in the coding exercises feels unfamiliar, especially since it's not commonly used in everyday language. It would help if more time were spent breaking down these new terms and walking through the code step by step, perhaps with more annotated examples or beginner-friendly explanations. That would make it easier to connect the concepts to their practical use in R."
"2025/09/30 9:07:23 AM AST","4","4","4","4","1","Agree","Agree","Disagree","Agree","This class has been great so far, but I feel like weeks 5 and 6 were quite a ramp up in skill level/competency. I think I might need to watch some more resources on Youtube or something to feel a little bit more comfortable/on the same page. It seems like there is a growing gap between people who are ""getting it"" vs not so intuitively getting it (me), so I'm hoping it starts to kick in and we can maybe slow down slightly during coding sessions. Thank you! Highly recommending this class to my advisor so she knows to encourage students to take it in the future."
"2025/09/30 9:10:44 AM AST","4","3","3","3","5","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","As of now, all aspects of the class have been helpful, especially breaking down the code into what it actually means and how it can be applied to other examples or in real life. I would like to explore further multiple pathways of achieving the same thing (which the professor has done a couple of times) and learning to ""think"" in code so that I can write it naturally. "
"2025/09/30 9:19:09 AM AST","5","4","4","3","3","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","I would like more homework assignments to practice these skills outside of class and feel more comfortable coding on my own. That being said I greatly appreciate the live coding documents and find them really helpful when I get stuck"
"2025/09/30 9:28:23 AM AST","5","3","2","3","3","Agree","Agree","Agree","Agree","I would love more opportunity to practice on my own without a grade being on the line. I feel like to really get these concepts in my head to where I will be able to use it actively, then I need to practice often.
Sometimes coding sessions can go very slow during the early moments as people as trouble or random errors, so then when we get to the more difficult parts we either have to rush through it or ""complete it later."" I would love to move faster at the start, so we can spend more time where it is really needed.

Love the class though and am learning so much! Thank you!"
